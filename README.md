Hi there, I'm Elizabeth. 

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Oklahoma.
I'm majoring in Information Studies. 
Before transferring to the University of Oklahoma for my Bachelor's, I went to Fullerton Community College in California where I earned my Associate's degree in Computer Information Systems.
My goal, after earning my Bachelor's, is to work on achieving a Master's degree in Library Science, so that I can become a Librarian.
